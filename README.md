#### Notes

An environmental variable REACT_APP_API_BASE is used throughout, which should be set to the backend api base url (e.g. 'https://domain.com/api').  No trailing slash.

Environmental variable REACT_APP_BACKEND is also needed for real-time stuff, which should be set to the backend base domain (e.g. 'https://domain.com').  No trailing slash.
